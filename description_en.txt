[h2]Multiplayer Support[/h2]
This addon supports multiplayer. However, there are the following points to note:
[list]
    [*]Speed and altitude are calculated on the host side. Therefore, the host player will always see accurate values, but the guest players may not see real-time values.
    [*]Settings made with the "?widget" custom command are stored individually for each player. The host player's settings are saved in the save data, but the guest player's settings are cleared when the guest player leaves.

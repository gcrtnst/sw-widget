[h1]Detailed Specifications[/h1]
[h2]Method for Measuring Speed/Altitude[/h2]
This addon calculates speed and altitude based on the player's position. Speed is determined by measuring the distance between the player's position in the previous tick and the current position. Altitude is extracted from the player's position.

[h2]Paintable Block Feature[/h2]
Sometimes, you may want to measure speed and altitude at a specific voxel inside the vehicle, rather than the player's speed and altitude. In such cases, follow these steps:
[olist]
    [*]Place a paintable block on the voxel where you want to measure speed and altitude.
    [*]Open the properties of the paintable block and set the Display Name to "?widget".
    [*]Spawn the vehicle.
    [*]Sit in one of the vehicle's seats.
[/olist]
While the player is seated in the vehicle, the addon will reference the position of the paintable block, instead of the player, to calculate speed and altitude.

You can determine which position the addon is referencing based on whether an asterisk is displayed on the widget label:
[list]
    [*]If it displays "SPD" and "ALT," it is referencing the player.
    [*]If it displays "SPD\*" and "ALT\*," it is referencing the paintable block.
[/list]

This feature can also be applied to sub-bodies of vehicles. For example, by attaching a paintable block to a missile on a vehicle, you can display the speed and altitude of that missile.

[h2]Multiplayer Support[/h2]
This addon supports multiplayer. However, there are some important notes:
[list]
    [*]Speed and altitude calculations are performed on the host. Therefore, the host player will always see accurate values, but guest players may not see real-time values.
    [*]Configuration made via the "?widget" custom command is saved individually for each player. The host player's settings are saved in the save data, but guest player settings are cleared when the guest player exits and are not saved.
